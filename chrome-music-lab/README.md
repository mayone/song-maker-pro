## Experiments

#### Arpeggios
- Using `webpack`
- An arpeggio is a chord played one note at a time. This experiment lets you play arpeggios in different patterns. Tap the wheel to explore major and minor chords.

#### Melody Maker
- Using `webpack`
- Grids like this one are a common interface for creating melodies. Time moves left to right and pitch goes up to down. Tap to add notes, then use the buttons on the bottom to play and change your melody.

#### Piano Roll
- Using `webpack`
- Originally, a piano roll was a roll of paper that you fed into a self-playing piano to make it play a piece. This experiment is inspired by piano rolls. You can watch the notes flow by, scrub it back and forth, and change the sounds.

#### Sound Waves
- Using `gulp`
- Sounds travel through the air like waves through water – but a lot faster. The blue dots represent air molecules bouncing back and forth as sound travels through them. Tap the magnifying glass to zoom in and see a red line graphing the position of one molecule, tracing the shape of the wave.

## ABOUT

[Chrome Music Lab](https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com) is a website that makes learning music more accessible through fun, hands-on experiments. We’re sharing open-source code here so that others can build new experiments based on what we’ve started. The experiments use a variety of tools – Web Audio API, WebRTC, WebMIDI, Tone.js, and more. We hope they’re useful as inspiration or reference for anyone who wants to create their own music projects on the web.

Consult the README in each experiment's folder for more information on building and running that experiment.
